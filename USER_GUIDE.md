Welcome to **AI Tracker**, your local-first, privacy-focused productivity and learning companion. Designed to help you seamlessly organize study sessions, track detailed analytics, and refine your study strategies over time without ever sending your data to a third-party server.

## 🚀 Getting Started

When you launch the application for the first time, take a few minutes to configure your core tracking pillars.

1. **Set Up Activities:** Navigate to the **Activities** tab (🎯). Add the core subjects, tasks, or habits you plan to track (e.g., *Current Affairs*, *Prelims Mock*, *Gym*, *Coding*). Assign custom icons and colors to tell them apart easily.
2. **Define Big Picture Goals:** Visit the **Goals** tab (🎯). Break down your overarching life or exam goals into actionable, hierarchical steps (e.g., *Clear UPSC 2026* → *Master Polity* → *Read Laxmikanth*).
3. **Establish a Baseline Timetable:** Go to **Timetable** (📅) and block out your ideal weekly routine. While no week is ever perfect, establishing this baseline allows the app to calculate your schedule adherence.

## 🛠️ Feature Breakdown

### 📊 Dashboard
The control center of your tracking. It displays your active streak, today's logged minutes, and an immediate breakdown of where your time went. As you accrue logs, the app uses **AI Insights** to actively analyze your trends and suggest adjustments (e.g., noting if you are under-studying a specific subject).

### ⏱️ Pomodoro
Built for deep work. Select one of your configured **Activities**, pick an interval (25m, 45m, 50m, 60m), and start the timer.
* When the session ends, the timer will automatically invite you to log the focused block, recording the *duration*, *activity*, and your self-assessed *focus level*. 
* It natively supports white noise to aid deep focus.

### 📅 Timetable
A visual weekly planner. Define blocks of time for your activities. The Dashboard will contrast your actual logs against this theoretical timetable to output an **Adherence Score**.

### 📋 Tests (Mock Exam Analysis)
A dedicated module to analyze your performance in *Prelims* (objective) or *Mains* (subjective) test series.
* Log total marks, your obtained score, test duration, and subject matter.
* Over time, the app calculates trendlines and highlights weak subjects.

### 📓 Diary
End your day with a reflection. The Diary tab asks for your overall *Mood (1-5)* and *Energy Level (1-5)*, a brain-dump of the day's events, *Wins*, *Challenges*, and your *Plan for Tomorrow*.
* **Why this matters:** The algorithm cross-references your mood and energy with your logged activity hours to automatically flag **Burnout Risks**.

### 📝 Review (Weekly Reflection)
At the end of the week, open the Review tab to synthesize a formal retrospective. It pulls your aggregate study hours, average mood, and active goals into a single view. 

### ⏪ Timeline
A chronologically ordered, Facebook-style scroll of every activity log or diary entry on a specific date. Helpful for identifying anomalies on low-productivity days.

### 📈 Analytics
High-level aggregations of your data.
* **Daily/Weekly/Monthly Trends:** See how much you study across various timeframes.
* **Heatmap:** Displays your logging intensity over the past year (like GitHub contribution graphs).
* **Brain Load & Energy Curve:** Maps *when* during the day you have the highest focus versus fatigue.

### 🔢 Metrics (Custom Trackers)
Want to track something arbitrary like "Pages Read", "Glasses of Water", or "Ran 5k today"? Create custom numeric or boolean trackers here. You monitor logs entirely independently of the core time-tracking system.

### 🔔 Reminders
Never miss a routine element again. Schedule automated, recurring desktop notifications (e.g., "Take a 5-minute walk" every weekday at 15:00). Reminders trigger seamlessly in the background.

## ⚡ Power-User Features

* **Sprint Mode:** Found at the bottom of the sidebar. Toggle this ON to mute unnecessary UI elements, switch to a high-contrast energetic theme, and put your brain into deep-focus mode.
* **Leveling System:** Logging activities and tests awards you **XP**. Watch your rank steadily climb from *Novice* to elite tiers as you consistently put in the hours.
* **Burnout Detector:** Located passively in the UI (or in Analytics). The app detects if you are registering high daily volume but logging low subjective energy/mood, warning you before mental exhaustion hits.

## 💡 Best Practices for Maximum Utility

1. **Be Honest with Focus Ratings:** When logging an activity, rate your focus accurately (1-5). Logging 4 hours of distracted study (Focus: 2) is mathematically worse than 2 hours of deep work (Focus: 5). The app's algorithms rely on this honesty.
2. **End-of-Day Ritual:** Make it a hard rule to fill out the **Diary** every single evening. The 2 minutes it takes to log your Energy and Mood is the bedrock for the app's advanced *Burnout* and *Momentum* analytics.
3. **Don't Over-Track:** Start with 3-5 core activities. Avoid the temptation to track every second of your day (e.g., eating, showering). Only track activities where you have *targets* to hit or *improvements* to measure (e.g., Study subjects, Gym, Deep reading).
4. **Use Tags in Tests:** Prefix your test topics consistently (e.g., `Polity-FundamentalRights`, `Economy-Macro`) so that trends naturally group your weaker areas in the Analytics view.
5. **Back up regularly:** Go to the Settings tab regularly and export your data as a JSON file. Because the app is 100% offline and local, you control your data security.
